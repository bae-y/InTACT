# InTACT `v1.0.0`

`InTACT` is a command line tool for testing gene-trait associations by integrating GWAS summary statistics with gene expression levels from multiple tissues. It returns *P*-values for both multi- and single-tissue association analyses.

InTACT has three compelling features that make it potentially useful in identifying novel gene-trait associations:

- It is very fast and maintains higher power than benchmark methods, that is, the burden sum test (i.e., the standard TWAS) and MultiXcan.
- It effectively integrates several tissue-specific and multi-tissue gene-trait association tests via Cauchy-distribution transformation.
- Its *P*-value is accurate by approximating it through the standard Cauchy distribution, especially when the *P*-values are small.

## Getting Started (Requirements)

First, clone this repository of `InTACT`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bae-y/InTACT.git
cd InTACT
```

Before running `InTACT`, you should download the following requirements into your `InTACT/` directory :

- `plink` from [PLINK1.9](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/),
- LD reference data (such as 1000 Genomes European ancestry data),
- the summary statistics data (such as from IGAP1) , and
- a file listing all the information for the weights files (such as TWAS/FUSION).

The file listing information for the weights files must have columns `WGT`, `ID`, `CHR`, `GENE`, `P0`, `P1`, `PANEL`, which will look like this:

           PANEL                                     WGT                 ID     GENE CHR       P0       P1
    ...

    143844  Lung    Lung/Lung.ENSG00000228314.1.wgt.RDat  ENSG00000228314.1 CYP4F29P  21 15215454 15220685
    ...

Also, please make sure that your R already has these libraries:

```R
R
install.packages(c('optparse','RColorBrewer','Rcpp','RcppArmadillo','bigmemory','mvtnorm','data.table'))
devtools::install_github("gabraham/plink2R/plink2R")
```

## Performing the InTACT

Once we have all the requirements, we can run `InTACT` with the following example command:

```bash
Rscript InTACT.R \
--sumstats IGAP1.rds \
--out out \
--weights TWAS_WEIGHTS.rds \
--weights_dir ./WEIGHTS/ \
--ref_ld_chr 1000G.EUR.MultiTissue.CHR \
--chr 21
```

Since `InTACT` analyzes one chromosome at a time, chromosome number is a required input.

## Reading the Results Files

For each chromosome, `InTACT` returns two files:

1. a result table of single-tissue association tests and
2. a result table of multi-tissue association tests.

The first table shows single-tissue association analyses for every single tissue. The columns `TWAS.P`, `SSU.P`, `ACAT.P` indicate the *P*-values of the burden sum test (i.e., the standard TWAS), the burden score test (i.e., sum of squared U test), and the Cauchy combination test, respectively. `Tk.P` represents the *P*-value of tissue *k*, after combining the three tissue-specific tests.

                             PANEL CHR                 ID ...    TWAS.P     SSU.P     ACAT.P      Tk.P

    ...

The second table shows the results from gene-trait association tests for `NPANEL` multiple tissues. The columns `T1m.P`, `MultiXcan.P`, `InTACT.P` stand for the *P*-values of the Cauchy-based joint test, MultiXcan, and InTACT, respectively. To compare their performance with the single-tissue test, we also provide the results for the standard TWAS (`BEST.TWAS.P`) to which we ought to apply the stringent Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold in further analysis.
